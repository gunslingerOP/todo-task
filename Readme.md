# What is this?

An answer to the to-do app task which was a part of my interview with Al-jad company.

# Tech used

## Prisma

This would be my first app using Prisma as my ORM, it has been very smooth enjoyable and I will definitely start using it instead of TypeORM

## NodeJS & ExpressJS

Not my first rodeo using these two, smooth development experience and large community support, especially for express.

# Functionality

Users can add and delete a to-do task as well as modify its status (in 3 stages as instructed)

# Routes

There are 3 main types of routes:

## 1

User routes: where a user can only register (for now)

## 2

To-do routes: where a user can add, delete and change the state of a singular to-do task

## 3

Data routes: where a user can get all of their to-do tasks or filter them by category. Moreover, the types of categories can be obtained from the data routes
